# WHILE, UNTIL & TIMES

# Use while to print a range of numbers from 1 to 5 

# num = 1
# while num < 6 do 
# 	puts num 
# 	num += 1
# end

# use until to print the same range 

num = 5
until num == 0 do
	puts num 
	num -= 1
end

# print the word "hello" 10 times 

# counter = 10 
# 10.times do 
# 	"hello"
# end
